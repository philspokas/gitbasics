* The focus is on simple use cases to ensure common understanding

We are using Git Version 2.46.0 for thes exercises.

## Notes ##

* The exercises should work just as well on Windows, Mac OS and Linux however note that the ```type``` Windows command is used to display the contents of a file whereas the ```cat``` command would be used on Linux
* Syntax of the git config command changed in later versions and -- is no longer required and the set command has been added
* We document the use of recently added commands including ```git restore``` and ```git switch```

* Install a current version of Git
* Install a modern text editor such as Visual Studio Code
